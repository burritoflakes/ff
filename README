Command line file uploader for fuckingfast.co


USAGE
-----
- Anonymous upload  - "./ff path/to/file.txt"
- User upload       - "./ff --dir=directoryId --token=userId path/to/file.txt"
- Silent upload     - "./ff --silent path/to/file.txt"

THE API
-------
1. Initialization: The uploader sends an initialization request to the server to get an upload ID and signed URLs for each chunk.
2. Chunk Upload: The file is divided into chunks(fixed 5 GB), and each chunk is uploaded to the server using the signed URLs.
3. Completion: Once all chunks are uploaded, a completion request is sent to the server to finalize the upload.

Example payloads:
